Slack is the tool defined by the SoftFIRE partners to manage discussion and support for experimenters during the Waves.

You can find [here](https://slack.com/is) all the info about this tool.

# User Registration and Policy
First at all, join our community from [here](https://softfire-slacking.herokuapp.com/).

To do this, please keep in mind the following requirements:
1. Use your organization/company email and register directly without our approval
2. You can add all the members of your team by your own, registering them on the link provided
3. Please, we require you use your real names only to create your SLACK account

# Public Channels
Please, join - after registration - #general: this channel is used for generic chat among partners and all the experimenter. Take a look here also for news, update and communications from the consortium.

Also, each Mentor will create a channel, naming it as expname-pub, inviting the proper reference from each team. Here, the mentor will invite the proper reference inside the partner to give you support on your experiment, case by case.

If you want, you can also join #random: this is a place for non-work-related flimflam, faffing, hodge-podge or jibber-jabber you'd prefer to keep out of more focused work-related channels.

# Private Channel:
Each Mentor will create a channel, naming it as expname-prv, inviting the proper users to join this channel to dive direct support during the wave. Please, use this channel priorly to ask for directions and starting support on your experimenter.

Please, remember to use REDMINE to logging bugs you will find across the platform only.
